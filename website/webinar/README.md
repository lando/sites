  In our <a href="https://thinktandem.io/blog/2020/04/28/lando-migration-webinar-part-1-followup/">last webinar</a> we covered the basics of Drupal migrations, including using Lando to host two databases, basic migration setup, and debugging.

  We'll wrap up the presentation within the hour, but will be available afterwards for further questions.
