  Over the last year we've watched our community grow from several hundred to over <b>10,000</b> and this exponential growth trajectory doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon!

  However, because so many users now rely on Lando we want to make sure it has a healthy and sustainable foundation for continued growth.

  For that reason we are launching _The Lando Alliance_, a movement of misfit developers, frustrated engineering managers and efficiency-minded business leaders and organizations who give a shit about making developers lives easier.

  <em>Our common cause?</em> To liberate developers across the galaxy so they can <strong>focus on their most important work</strong> by providing great developer tools, content, documentation, events, trainings and tutorials.

  Lando itself is <em>free and open source</em> software and relies on community contributions to sustain itself. So, if you like Lando and think it's valuable we'd highly encourage you to return some of that by joining our movement.

  The Alliance functions as a positive feedback loop so with your participation we can cover infrastruture costs, compensate our team of developers, fix bugs, sponsor evangelists, provide community support, build new features and most importantly continue to spread our message of freedom, justice, beauty and truth to make developer's lives easier even in the far reaches of the internet.

  <b><em>We're down to keep solving DevOps and with your help we can.</em></b>

  If you're interested in reading more about <em>The Alliance</em>, what it is and how it works then check out our [announcement post](https://blog.lando.dev/2020/02/14/announcing-lando-alliance/).
